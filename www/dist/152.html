      <div data-role="main" class="ui-content"><p>A land free from destruction, plus wealth, natural resources, and labor supply-all these were important factors, in helping England to become the center for the Industrial Revolution. <u>  31   </u>they were not enough. Something else was needed to start the industrial process. That "something special" was men-<u>  32   </u>individuals who could invent machines, find new sources of power, and establish business organizations to reshape society.</p>
<p>The men who<u>   33   </u>the machines of the Industrial Revolution came from many backgrounds and many occupations. Many of them were<u>   34  </u> inventors than scientists. A man who is a pure scientist is primarily interested in doing his research <u>   35   </u>.  He is not necessarily working so that his findings can be used. An inventor or one interested in applied science is ~6 trying to make something that has a concrete idea. He may try to solve a problem by using the theories <u>  36   </u> science or by experimenting through trial and error. Regardless of his method, he is working to obtain a specific result: the construction of a harvesting machine, the burning of a light bulb, or one of <u>  38    </u>0ther objectives.</p>
<p>Most of the people who developed the machines of the Industrial Revolution were inventors, not trained scientists. A few were both scientists and inventors. Even those who had <u>   39    </u>0r no training in science might not have made their inventions if a groundwork had not been laid by scientists years<u>   40  </u>.</p>
